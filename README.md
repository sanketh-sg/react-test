These days, code that runs in the browser uses ES6 modules. Modules are defined with an export and included in the current file with an import.

Node.js uses CommonJS modules. The reason for this is that the Node ecosystem needed modules long before JavaScript supported them in the language specification. Currently, Node also supports the use of ES6 modules, but since the support is not quite perfect yet, we'll stick to CommonJS modules.

In fact, a large majority of the world's purported "REST" APIs do not meet Fielding's original criteria outlined in his dissertation.

Without the json-parser, the body property would be undefined. The json-parser takes the JSON data of a request, transforms it into a JavaScript object and then attaches it to the body property of the request object before the route handler is called.

whenever Express gets an HTTP GET request it will first check if the dist directory contains a file corresponding to the request's address. If a correct file is found, Express will return it.

Now HTTP GET requests to the address www.serversaddress.com/index.html or www.serversaddress.com will show the React frontend. GET requests to the address www.serversaddress.com/api/notes will be handled by the backend code.
